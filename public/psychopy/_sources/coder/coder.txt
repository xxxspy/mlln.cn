Coder
================================================

.. note::

    These do not teach you about Python `per se`, and you are recommended also to learn about that (`Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ has many excellent tutorials for programmers and non-programmers alike). In particular, dictionaries, lists and numpy arrays are used a great deal in most PsychoPy experiments.

You can learn to use the scripting interface to PsychoPy in several ways, and you should probably follow a combination of them:

	- :ref:`concepts`: some of the logic of PsychoPy scripting
	- :ref:`tutorials`:  walk you through the development of some semi-complete experiments
	- demos: in the demos menu of Coder view. Many and varied
	- use the :ref:`builder` to :ref:`compile a script <compileScript>` and see how it works
	- check the :ref:`api` for further details
	- ultimately go into PsychoPy and start examining the source code. It's just regular python!
