PsychoPy official workshops
===============================

The following workshop is currently planned for 2018:

 - 16-18 Apr 2018: :ref:`PEP1`

You can now `book your place on this 3 day Python workshop <http://store.nottingham.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/conferences/schools-and-departments/psychology/pep-2018-programming-experiments-in-python-beginners>`_

Do you want to get started using Python_ (and PsychoPy_) for your studies in behavioural sciences? Maybe you keep meaning to switch from another applications and haven't gotten around to it. These workshops, run by the creators of PsychoPy, will get you off the ground with building and analysing your experiments using Python.

`Python`_ is a powerful well-designed programming language that's totally free and runs on all operating systems. It's a little like a free replacement for Matlab, but with more flexibility and better syntax! Learning to program is a hugely important skill for scientists in the modern environment and the workshops we run (Beginner and Intermediate) will help you a great deal both in the basics of how to run a study but also in more general programming (like how to run a simulation, how to analyse data or how to alter a large number of image files in a script).

`PsychoPy`_ is a modern, powerful, easy-to-use software package for conducting studies in psychophysics, neuroimaging and experimental psychology. It's become the package of choice in very many labs worldwide (see `PsychoPy usage stats <http://www.psychopy.org/usage.php>`_). It comes with a graphical interface (Builder) as well as a `Python` scripting interface (Coder). The workshops we run cater to various audiences, according to whether you want to learn more about programming (most flexible) or about the graphical interface (fastest way to get a study up and running).

The workshops are led by Jon Peirce, who created the core of PsychoPy and has been programming in Python and teaching behavioural scientists since 2003.

Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    :When: 16-18 April 2018 (inclusive)
    :Where: School of Psychology, University of Nottingham
    :Cost: £350
    :Includes: Refreshments and lunch. There is an accommodation package too, costing £50 per night including bed, full breakfast and free wifi
    :Content:
        Material will cover *Python* programming basics as well as PsychoPy-specific coding. Note that this is not a workshop about PsychoPy Builder; we'll really be focussing on programming.

Is this suitable for you?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The target audience is those that want to learn to program in Python for general use in science. We will focus on generating experiments: presenting stimuli and collecting responses, but we will cover basic analyses and plotting in Python as well.

We'll provide you with additional 'intermediate' material as well, for you to build on what you've learnt, but if you're already a proficient programmer in Python then this is probably not the course for you.

Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We'll not start the first formal session until 10am on Day 1 (coffee available from 9am though) and we'll finish at 4pm on Day 3 to allow some travel flexibility. But you are welcome to hang around and continue working if you prefer.

All sessions subject to change. Sessions in **green** and **blue** are optional (for self-paced and specialist sessions, respectively).
