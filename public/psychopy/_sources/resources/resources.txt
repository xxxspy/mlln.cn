Resources (e.g. for teaching)
=====================================

There are a number of further resources to help learn/teach about PsychoPy.

If you also have PsychoPy materials/course then please let us know so that we can link to them from here too!

Workshops
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are now several official workshops, run at Nottinghamby the creators of PsychoPy. These cater to different needs (Builder, Beginners Programming, Intermediate Programming). Please see the page on :ref:`officialWorkshops` for further details.

Youtube tutorials
-----------------

- `Youtube PsychoPy tutorial <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV6qhuQgsiI>`_ showing how to build a basic experiment in the :ref:`builder` interface. That's a great way to get started; build your own complete experiment in 15 minutes flat!

- There's also a `subtitled version of the stroop video tutorial <https://www.universalsubtitles.org/en/videos/rBzTFjunIDB2>`_ (Thanks Kevin Cole for doing that!)

Materials for Builder
---------------------

- At `School of Psychology, University of Nottingham`_, PsychoPy is now used for all first year practical class teaching. The classes that comprise that first year course are provided below. They were created partially with funding from the former `Higher Education Academy Psychology Network`_. Note that the materials here will be updated frequently as they are further developed (e.g. to update screenshots etc) so make sure you have the latest version of them!

        `PsychoPy_pracs_2011v2.zip (21MB) <PsychoPy_pracs_2011v2.zip>`_ (last updated: 15 Dec 2011)

- The `GestaltReVision group (University of Leuven) wiki <http://gestaltrevision.be/wiki/python>`_ covering PsychoPy (some Builder info and great tutorials for Python/PsychoPy coding of experiments).

Materials for Coder
-------------------

- `Gary Lupyan <http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/>`_ runs a class on programming experiments using Python/PsychoPy and makes his lecture materials available `on this wiki <http://sapir.psych.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Psych711>`_

- The `GestaltReVision group (University of Leuven) <http://gestaltrevision.be>`_ offers a `three-day crash course to Python and PsychoPy on a IPython Notebook <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/gestaltrevision/python_for_visres/blob/master/index.ipynb>`_, and has lots of great information taking you from basic programming to advanced techniques.

- Radboud University, Nijmegen also has a `PsychoPy programming course <https://www.socsci.ru.nl/~wilberth/nocms/psychopy/print.php>`_

- `Programming for Psychology in Python - Vision Science <http://www.djmannion.net/programming_vision>`_ has lessons and screencasts on PsychoPy (Damien Mannion, UNSW Australia).
