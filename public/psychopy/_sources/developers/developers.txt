For Developers
=====================================

There is a separate mailing list to discuss development ideas and issues.

For developers the best way to use PsychoPy is to install a version to your own copy of python (preferably 2.6 but 2.5 is OK). Make sure you have all the :ref:`dependencies`, including the extra :ref:`suggestedPackages` for developers.

Don't *install* PsychoPy. Instead fetch a copy of the git repository and add this to the python path using a .pth file. Other users of the computer might have their own standalone versions installed without your repository version touching them.
