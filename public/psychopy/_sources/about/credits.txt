Credits
=====================================

PsychoPy is developed almost entirely by volunteers. If you see those contributors at a conference do pat them on the back and say thanks. And if you need a (paid) consultant on your project then the people listed on this page would be good candidates!

Developers
---------------

PsychoPy was initially created and maintained by `Jon Peirce`_ but has many contributors to the code. For a full list you can see the contributions on `openhub.net <https://www.openhub.net/p/PsychoPy/contributors>`_ but some notable contributors are:

    **Jeremy Gray**, **Sol Simpson**, Mike MacAskill, Jonas Lindeløv, Richard Höchenberger, Hiroyuki Sogo, Yaroslav Halchenko, Erik Kastman, William Hogman, Ilixa Ltd., Gary Strangman

You can see `details of contributions on Ohloh.net <https://www.ohloh.net/p/PsychoPy/contributors/summary>`_ and there's a (rather out of date) visualisation of `PsychoPy's development history <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0xZvHLFrl4>`_ on youtube.

If you need substantial support from anyone in that team you may be able to hire them as consultants on your project.

**The logic and core** of the library and application (including the Builder view) were Jon's creation.

**Jeremy Gray** added many features (including **audio recording** and the **Rating Scale**)

**Sol Simpson** wrote ioHub (the most advanced Python library for eye-tracking and precise hardware interfacing). If you need support for some advanced Python code especially in the field of hardware and eyetracking you might want to chat wit Sol.

`Ilixa Ltd.`_ wrote the new **PsychoJS library** with funding from `Center for Open Science`_. `PsychoJS` will allow PsychoPy Builder experiments to be launched online, and *Ilixa* have done a wonderful job of creating the JavaScript equivalent of the original PsychoPy Python library. If you need a `science programmer <http://www.ilixa.com>`_, then *Ilixa Ltd.* come with Jon's personal recommendation.

PsychoPy also stands on top of a large number of other developers' work. It wouldn't be possible to write this package without the preceding work of those that wrote the :ref:`dependencies`

Support and training providers
-----------------------------------

Software projects aren't just about code. A great deal of work is done by the community in terms of supporting each other.

You can see the most `active posters on the user forum <https://discourse.psychopy.org/u?period=all`_ and those `answering PsychoPy questions on StackOverflow here <http://stackoverflow.com/tags/psychopy/info>`_ but notable examples that have done a fantastic job of supporting users:

    * Jeremy Gray (USA)
    * Mike MacAskill (New Zealand)
    * Jonas Lindeløv (Denmark)
    * Richard Höchenberger (Germany)

If you need PsychoPy/Python workshop then these might be good people to contact (according to where you are) but please understand that we need to charge for running workshops because it takes us away form our "day jobs"

Funding
----------------

The PsychoPy project has attracted small grants from the following organisations:
    * the `Higher Education Academy`_ Psychology Network
    * `Cambridge Research Systems`_
    * the `Center for Open Science`_.

Jon is paid by `The University of Nottingham`_ (which allows him to spend time on this) and his previous grants from the `BBSRC`_ and `Wellcome Trust`_ have also helped the development PsychoPy.
