General Advice
--------------

-	Python and therefore PsychoPy is CASE SENSITIVE
-	To use a dollar sign ($) for anything other than to indicate a code snippet for example in a :ref:`text`, precede it with a backslash ``\$`` (the backslash won't be printed)
-	Have you entered your the settings for your :ref:`monitor <builderMonitors>`? If you are using degrees as a unit of measurement and have not entered your monitor settings, the size of stimuli will not be accurate.
-	If your experiment is not behaving in the way that you expect. Have you looked at the :ref:`log file <logFile>`? This can point you in the right direction. Did you know you can change the type of information that is stored in the log file in preferences by changing the :ref:`logging level <codeLogging>`.
-	Have you tried compiling the script and running it. Does this produce a particular error message that points you at a particular problem area? You can also change things in a more detailed way in the coder view and if you are having problems, reading through the script can highlight problems. Reading a compiled script can also help with the creation of a :ref:`code`
