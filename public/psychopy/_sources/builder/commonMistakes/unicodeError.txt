-	This type of error is usually caused by a naming conflict. Whilst we have made every attempt to make sure that these conflicts produce a warning message it is possible that they may still occur.
-	The most common source of naming conflicts in an external file which has been imported to be used in a loop i.e. .xlsx, .csv. 
-	Check to make sure that all of the variable names are unique. There can be no repeated variable names anywhere in your experiment.
