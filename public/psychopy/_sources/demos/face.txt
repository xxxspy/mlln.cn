Draw a rotating face
=====================================

This demo shows a couple of uses of bitmap images. You can use them either as textures for images or as the mask for another texture (the face on the left is used as a mask for a blue and yellow grating).

To work the demo needs a square image called face.jpg (e.g. :download:`../images/face.jpg`) 

.. image:: ../images/demo_face.jpg
   :target: documentation.html
   :alt: draw a drifting plaid

.. literalinclude:: face.py
